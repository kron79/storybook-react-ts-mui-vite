# Want to try out?

2. Install dependencies `npm i`

### Build commands
* `npm run build` - Bundles your source code to exportable library with **ESM** and **UMD** support

# What's special with this?

* It's a project as a **UI library for React.JS** setup
* It's tailored to extend [MUI library](https://mui.com/)

# What's with the weird folder names? (eg: "Atoms")

Feel free to rename the files/folder, I'm just simply following the [Atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principle by *Brad Frost*.
